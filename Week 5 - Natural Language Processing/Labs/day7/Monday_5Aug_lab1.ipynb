Our task is called `Word Window Classification` for a reason. Instead of letting our model to only take a look at one word in each forward pass, we would like it to be able to consider the context of the word in question. That is, for each word, we want our model to be aware of the surrounding words. Let's dive in!"

    "For example, let's take the sentence \"We always come to Paris\". The corresponding training label for this sentence is `0, 0, 0, 0, 1` since only Paris, the last word, is a `LOCATION`. In one pass (meaning a call to `forward()`), our model will try to generate the correct label for one word. Let's say our model is trying to generate the correct label `1` for `Paris`. If we only allow our model to see `Paris`, but nothing else, we will miss out on the important information that the word `to` often times appears with `LOCATION`s.\n",

    "Word windows allow our model to consider the surrounding `+N` or `-N` words of each word when making a prediction. In our earlier example for `Paris`, if we have a window size of 1, that means our model will look at the words that come immediately before and after `Paris`, which are `to`, and, well, nothing. Now, this raises another issue. `Paris` is at the end of our sentence, so there isn't another word following it. Remember that we define the input dimensions of our `PyTorch` models when we are initializing them. If we set the window size to be `1`, it means that our model will be accepting `3` words in every pass. We cannot have our model expect `2` words from time to time.\n",

    "Now that we have an index for each word in our vocabularly, we can create an embedding table with `nn.Embedding` class in `PyTorch`. It is called as follows `nn.Embedding(num_words, embedding_dimension)` where `num_words` is the number of words in our vocabulary and the `embedding_dimension` is the dimension of the embeddings we want to have. There is nothing fancy about `nn.Embedding`: it is just a wrapper class around a trainabe `NxE` dimensional tensor, where `N` is the number of words in our vocabulary and `E` is the number of embedding dimensions. This table is initially random, but it will change over time. As we train our network, the gradients will be backpropagated all the way to the embedding layer, and hence our word embeddings would be updated. We will initiliaze the embedding layer we will use for our model in our model, but we are showing an example here."

    "#### Batching Sentences\n",
    "\n",
    "We have learned about batches in lecture. Waiting our whole training corpus to be processed before making an update is costly. On the other hand, updating the parameters after every training example causes the loss to be less stable between updates. To combat these issues, we instead update our parameters after training on a batch of data. This allows us to get a better estimate of the gradient of the global loss. In this section, we will learn how to structure our data into batches using the `torch.util.data.DataLoader` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be calling the `DataLoader` class as follows: `DataLoader(data, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True, collate_fn=collate_fn)`.  The `batch_size` parameter determines the number of examples per batch. In every epoch, we will be iterating over all the batches using the `DataLoader`. The order of batches is deterministic by default, but we can ask `DataLoader` to shuffle the batches by setting the `shuffle` parameter to `True`. This way we ensure that we don't encounter a bad batch multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "If provided, `DataLoader` passes the batches it prepares to the `collate_fn`. We can write a custom function to pass to the `collate_fn` parameter in order to print stats about our batch or perform extra processing. In our case, we will use the `collate_fn` to:\n",
    "1. Window pad our train sentences.\n",
    "2. Convert the words in the training examples to indices.\n",
    "3. Pad the training examples so that all the sentences and labels have the same length. Similarly, we also need to pad the labels. This creates an issue because when calculating the loss, we need to know the actual number of words in a given example. We will also keep track of this number in the function we pass to the `collate_fn` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because our version of the `collate_fn` function will need to access to our `word_to_ix` dictionary (so that it can turn words into indices), we will make use of the `partial` function in `Python`, which passes the parameters we give to the function we pass it."
